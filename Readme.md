 Theming
 
 ## Color Theming : https://material.io/develop/android/theming/color/
 Concept is to use themes to control app styling instead if putting parameters to each view. Following procedure is used to achieve this
 
 - App uses baseline Material color theme format mentioned here : https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation 
 - Use the diagram mentioned in above link and generate baseline Material color from here : https://material.io/tools/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=1&primary.color=009688&secondary.color=fcfc13
